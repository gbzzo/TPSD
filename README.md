# TPSD
This repo offers a download link for the TPSD Dataset proposed in the paper *Context-Aware Deep Network with Cross-Layer Feature Fusion for Polyp Segmentation in Colonoscopy Images*

The dataset is now available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MXmCzoixR2FX8KthZbVrK2jyoI2BKLPW/view?usp=sharing). Note that the dataset must be for research use only, and the annotations are therefore protected with a passphrase. Please contact me for decryption if you are interested in the data. Thank you!
