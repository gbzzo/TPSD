# TPSD
This repo offers a download link for the TPSD Dataset proposed in the paper *Context-Aware Deep Network with Cross-Layer Feature Fusion for Polyp Segmentation in Colonoscopy Images*

# How to get the data
The dataset is now available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MXmCzoixR2FX8KthZbVrK2jyoI2BKLPW/view?usp=sharing). Note that the dataset must be for research use only, and the annotations are therefore protected with a passphrase. Please contact me for decryption if you are interested in the data. Thank you!

# More Details
The dataset archive consists of three folders: `images`, `annotations` and `datasets`
- The `images` folder contains two subdirectories, namely `NBI` and `WLI`, which stand for the *Narrow Band Images* and the *White Light Images*, respectively.
- The `annotations` folder shares the same directory structure as `images`.
- The `datasets` folder contains ten train-test spit pairs, which are used in our experiments.
